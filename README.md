# Command-Queue-for-Actions
A **Command Queue** is a design pattern that uses a **queue-based structure** (FIFO) to **collect commands each frame** and **process them consistently**, separating game systems from object behavior. It organizes game logic around queued commands and **helps control actions in a clean and flexible way**.
